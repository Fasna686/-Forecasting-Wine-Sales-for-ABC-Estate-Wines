# Forecasting-Wine-Sales-for-ABC-Estate-Wines
**Time Series Forecasting**

#### Project Overview:
In this project, the goal was to analyze historical monthly sales data from ABC Estate Wines, a company with a rich history in the wine industry throughout the 20th century. The analysis focused on two distinct wine products, aiming to identify trends, patterns, and factors that influenced their sales over the years. By applying various time series forecasting models, the project sought to provide actionable insights and accurate sales predictions for the company.

#### Problem Context:
As analysts at ABC Estate Wines, we were tasked with investigating historical sales data for different types of wines produced by the company. The data spanned the entire 20th century, providing a comprehensive view of the company's sales history. The primary challenge was to explore the data, uncover trends and patterns, and understand the factors driving wine sales over time. These insights would be critical in shaping future sales strategies and helping the company maintain a competitive edge in the dynamic wine industry.

#### Objective:
The main objective of this project was to forecast wine sales for the upcoming 12 months using historical data from ABC Estate Wines. By leveraging time series forecasting techniques, we aimed to provide ABC Estate Wines with precise sales predictions, including upper and lower confidence limits. These forecasts would enable the company to optimize its sales strategies, capitalize on emerging market opportunities, and improve overall sales performance.

#### Approach:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted an in-depth analysis of the time series data to understand historical sales trends and patterns for the two selected wine products.
- **Forecasting Models:** Developed multiple forecasting models, including Exponential Smoothing Models, ARIMA/SARIMA, and Moving Average Models, to predict future sales.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the performance of each model and recommended the most suitable forecasting model for predicting the monthly sales of the two wine products for the next 12 months.

#### Skills & Tools Covered:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis for Time Series Data**
- **Exponential Smoothing Models**
- **ARIMA/SARIMA Models**
- **Moving Average Models**

#### Outcome:
The project successfully identified the optimal forecasting model for each wine product, providing ABC Estate Wines with accurate monthly sales predictions for the next year. The forecasts included appropriate confidence intervals, offering valuable insights for strategic planning and sales optimization.

This project not only enhanced our understanding of time series forecasting techniques but also demonstrated their practical application in the wine industry, helping ABC Estate Wines make data-driven decisions to sustain and grow its market presence.
